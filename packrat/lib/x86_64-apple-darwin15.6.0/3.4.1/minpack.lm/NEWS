Version 1.2-1
  o In some cases 'profile.nls' would not work on models created with 'nlsLM', due to a wrong class assignment in the output ("call" instead of "numeric"). This bug was kindly made aware by Patrice Kiener and removed.
  o License is now only GPL-3; per clause 7 we include the University of
  Chicago license terms as a supplement.  

Version 1.2-0
  o Removed a small bug in 'nlsLM' that gave an error if an external function was supplied within the formula syntax, e.g. y ~ fitModel(x, a). This was made aware by an email from C. Softley, pointing to a discussion and solution in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30089698/error-in-evalexpr-envir-enclos-could-not-find-function-nested-functions.  

Version 1.1-9
	o Modified NAMESPACE and added Suggests: MASS to DESCRIPTION file.
Version 1.1-8
	o The new function wfct for easy specification of weights in nls and
	  nlsLM is now included.  
Version 1.1-7 
	o changed the License to GPL-3 + the terms specified in the file 
          LICENSE, which give the original copyright distributed with  
          the minpack Fortran source.  This is possible given Clause 7 in 
	  GPL-3.  
Version 1.1-6
	o Support for lower and upper bounds added
	o Added 'nlsLM', a modified version of 'nls' that uses ‘nls.lm’ for
          fitting.
